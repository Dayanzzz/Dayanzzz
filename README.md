## Hi there üëã  
Hey there, Hamilton here. I'm a software engineer with a diverse journey behind me. I worked in various ops-based roles, then pivoted towards work that I found to be more rewarding and aligned with my values, leading me to pursue dentistry from 2017-2022. A health scare prompted me to take a leave of absence, and during that time off, I leaned into my passion for decentralization and the empowering potential of related technologies.  

I embraced that interest, went through an intensive coding bootcamp, and am now equipped with a diverse background and fresh set of technical skills eager to contribute to the space.  

Feel free to explore my GitHub and reach out if you'd like to learn more about anything (-:
